===Python===
list Decode(long offset, string code, int mode)
Input:
offset - *Virtual* address of the code itself (as in origin)
code -   Buffer of the binary code
mode -      Decode16Bits - 80286 decoding
            Decode32Bits - IA-32 decoding
            Decode64Bits - AMD64 decoding
Return:
list - List of tuples with the disassembled instructions,
       each tuple consists of offset, size, mnemonic and hex strings per instruction
